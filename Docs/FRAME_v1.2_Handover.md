**FRAME Project Handover: v1.1 to v1.2**

**Date**: 2025-07-22

**Objective**: To provide complete context for transitioning from strategic planning to active development execution of FRAME v1.2.

---

## 1.0 Final Session State

* **1.1. Last Objective**: The primary objective of this session was to collaboratively ideate, plan, and formalise a comprehensive, long-term strategic roadmap for the FRAME project. This included integrating multiple foundational frameworks, research findings, and establishing robust governance and development processes.

* **1.2. Outcome**: **Completed.** We have successfully produced the definitive `Docs/Master_Development_Brief.md` v1.2.0. This document now serves as the single source of truth for the project, detailing the vision, architectural principles, and a fully prioritised, multi-phase roadmap from v1.2 through v2.1+.

* **1.3. Key Learnings/Blockers**:
   * **Key Learning**: We established several critical, formal processes that are now core to the FRAME methodology:
      1. A **"Core and Adapter"** architecture to ensure portability across IDEs (Claude Code, VS Code, etc.).
      2. A **"Tiered Knowledge Strategy"** for building expert agentic expansions (Embedded Knowledge, Embedded Skills, Live Augmentation).
      3. A **formal governance and security framework** (aligning with ISO 27001, ISO 42001, and NIST AI RMF).
      4. A **dynamic prioritisation process** using the MoSCoW method with Airtable integration.
      5. A **formal elicitation stage** to clarify requirements before development using multi-agent systems.
      6. A **Technical Options Analysis** stage for research-driven technology selection.
      7. A **comprehensive project management methodology** with templates for briefs, handovers, concept proposals, and technical analysis.
   * **Blockers**: There are no immediate blockers. The project is ready to move into the execution phase with all foundational documentation and processes established.

* **1.4. Intended Next Step**: The next action is to begin the execution of the first high-priority item on the roadmap: **User Story/Issue #101: Define Hybrid AI Comms Protocol**, as detailed in the Master Development Brief.

## 4.0 Next Objective for v1.2 Development

The objective for the new session is to begin execution of **FRAME v1.2** by creating the detailed **Task Specification** for **User Story/Issue #101: Define Hybrid AI Comms Protocol**.

**Specific Actions Required**:
1. Create detailed task specification using established templates
2. Conduct Technical Options Analysis for MCP vs JSON-RPC implementation
3. Begin implementation planning for hybrid communication protocol
4. Establish development environment and CI/CD pipeline foundations

**Success Criteria**: Completion of Task Specification document and initiation of User Story #101 implementation with clear technical approach and timeline for FRAME v1.2 delivery.
