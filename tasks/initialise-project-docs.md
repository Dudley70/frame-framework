# Task: Initialise Project Documentation
## Purpose
To set up the standard FRAME project management documentation for a new project, ensuring a consistent structure for strategic planning and session handovers.
## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution
### 1. Check for Existing Docs
- Verify if a `Docs/` directory already exists. If it contains a `Master_Development_Brief.md`, this task has likely already been completed. Abort to prevent overwriting existing plans.
### 2. Create Documentation Directory
- If it does not exist, create a new directory at the project root named `Docs/`.
### 3. Copy Templates
- Copy the file `templates/Master_Development_Brief_Template.md` to `Docs/Master_Development_Brief.md`.
- Copy the file `templates/Handover_Template.md` to `Docs/Handover_Template.md`.
### 4. Update Master Brief
- Open `Docs/Master_Development_Brief.md`.
- Update the `Version` and `Last Updated` fields at the top of the document to reflect the current project version and date.
### 5. Confirmation
- Announce that the project documentation has been successfully initialised and is ready for planning.
