# Task: Conduct Technical Options Analysis

## Purpose
To perform up-to-date research on rapidly evolving technologies and provide a justified recommendation before committing to a specific tool in a technical specification.

## Assigned Persona
- Research Analyst Agent

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution

### 1. Ingest the Core Requirement
- Load the specified `Concept_CXXX.md` document to understand the underlying need (e.g., "we need real-time, high-accuracy voice transcription").

### 2. Formulate Search Queries
- Based on the requirement, formulate a set of precise search queries to gather the latest information. The queries should target comparisons, pricing, performance benchmarks, and recent market entrants.
- Example Queries for Voice Transcription:
    - "best real-time transcription APIs July 2025"
    - "AssemblyAI vs Deepgram vs Whisper API accuracy and latency 2025"
    - "new voice transcription services launched H1 2025"
    - "open source voice transcription models performance"

### 3. Execute Research
- Use the available search tools to execute the queries.
- Synthesise the findings from the top results, focusing on data published within the last 6 months.

### 4. Populate the Analysis Document
- Create a new document: `Docs/Analysis/TOA_CXXX_[Technology_Name].md` using the `Technical_Options_Analysis_Template.md`.
- Fill in the template with the synthesised research data, comparing the top 2-3 options across the standard criteria.

### 5. Formulate a Recommendation
- Based on the analysis, provide a final, time-stamped recommendation.
- The recommendation should be justified and include any identified risks or trade-offs.

### 6. Submit for Review
- Announce that the Technical Options Analysis is complete and ready for human review and approval.
