# BMad Knowledge Base

## Overview

BMad-Method (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies.

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows.

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details.
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.).
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code.
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective.
